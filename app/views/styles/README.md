# Styles

Make your service look and feel like the Care Quality Commission

If you are using [Care Quality Commission Frontend (coming soon)](#) in your build or prototype, the coded examples in the Design System won’t need any additional styling.

If you need to apply styles manually, you should still follow existing Care Quality Commission conventions. For example, don’t assign new meanings to colours, don’t change the style of buttons or adjust the thickness of borders on form inputs.

See all the [styles in the backlog](https://github.com/CQCDigital/design-system-backlog/issues).
